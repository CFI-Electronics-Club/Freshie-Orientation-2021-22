### Problem - 1

Play this game and score about 60 points: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6nSdspNbZXI

### Problem - 2

You go to a fair and want to play High-striker (strongman game). But just before your turn, the game malfunctions. To fix this, you have to Design a circuit using Arduino and force sensor that imitates the game.
- The output should have a series of LEDs that glow up according to the amount of force that is applied.
- When maximum force is applied, a buzzer should ring

Bonus : Try using a neopixel LED strip and make it glow when maximum force is applied.

### Problem - 3 

It’s the holiday season and you are tasked with handling the music system for your family get-together. Unfortunately, the music system that you ordered got delayed and will surely not arrive in time for the party. So, you Decide to make a circuit using the Neopixel LED Circular Ring to generate patterns and to play a festive song in the Piezo Buzzer to match the LED pattern. Try making it as creative as you can!

### Problem - 4

You miss the old Nokia days and want to play a few of the classical games again. Unfortunately, you don’t have a Nokia phone anymore. To play a game again, Design a circuit using Arduino, LED’s (matrix) and push buttons/toggle switch to play the snake game.

You can build upon this circuit : [multiplexing](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3HH2Ll2EfFT-multiplexing)
